### Input
- The `input()` function pauses program execution to allow the user to type in a line of input from the keyboard. 
- Once the user presses the Enter key, all characters typed are read and returned as a string
``` python
user_input = input("What is your name?")
print(user_input)
```

#### Output
- You can display program data to the console in Python with `print()`.
- To display objects to the console, pass them as a comma-separated list of arguments to `print()`.
``` python
print(<obj1>, <obj2>, <obj3>, ..., sep="-",end="\n")
# obj1-obj2-obj3... <Next Line>
```
